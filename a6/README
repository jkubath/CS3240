Assignment 6 --  A simple server

You are to write a file server which will handle GET requests consistent with HTTP1.2 

You must do that by creating a socket that the client can use. You must handle multiple clients, each provided a thread. 

Media types you must handle include mp3, and jpeg ... Can you extend that to video ? 

A thread pool (skeleton of which is provided) earns bonus points. 

This is due at final exam. 

I have provided three media items ... a koala, an mp3 and a cartoon that is funny. 

This is a quick and dirty README. I have provided an example of client , server code previously but because you can't say for sure, i provide it here as well. 

BUT THERE"S MORE !

Also in the repo is *magic*. 

Magic.c is a piece of code which will take (as a command line argument) a path/filename and return the content type field that needs to be provided in the response header to the GET request. 
Of course, you must first install magic using 

sudo apt-get install libmagic-dev 

and then use the magic functions such as the magic cookie function magic_open() to get the mime type for usage in response header. 

Note that you are installing the magic library which must be loaded with -lmagic.

Please make your code executable by <command> <portnumber>, so that I can specify the port to bind the socket to on the command line
'./server 3240' should open a http server that runs on port 3240
